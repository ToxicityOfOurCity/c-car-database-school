# C car database.

This is a "simple" (800 lines believe otherwise) program in C, it was originally a school project, but it ended up taking so much of my time i uploaded it here.
Something worth mentioning is that i am aware the program is in extreme beginner style, from its algorithms and syntax, but it is also the schools instructions to NOT go too overboard.
bubble sort for example, was the only sorting that i was allowed to use.

The program consists of multiple stuff. I won't list all of them HERE, but you are welcome to use the source-code, compile it and then use it.

# Main Menu

Upon opening the .exe, the user is greeted with this main menu:

![mainmenu](/images/main_menu.png)

And presented with 7 choices.

 1. Show the whole cars.txt database.

 2. Insert a new car to the database. <sup>(not explained in order to not take up a lot of space)</sup>

 3. Delete a car from the database. <sup>(not explained in order to not take up a lot of space)</sup>

 4. Update an existing car in the database.

 5. Search for cars in the database.

 6. Manually Save the database (also in the instructions of the project, not my choice.)

 0. Exit the program.

## Printing the entire database.

pressing 1 then enter will plainly print the entire (SAVED database.)

example is here:

![print](/images/1st_choice.png)

## Search menu includes a whole different menu.

If you ask to search for cars, you'll be greeted by a second menu!

## Manually saving the database.

Just making a change wont register in the files, it'll stay in the ram, you need a small action to save it.

thats the sixth choice:

![change](/images/manualsave.png)

---

## And finally, in case you forget the manual save and try to change anything else or leave the programm, you have this second warning!
